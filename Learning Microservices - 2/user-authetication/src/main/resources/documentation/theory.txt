1. We just add spring security dependency and spring auto generates a password with a default username as 'user'.

2. 5 Spring Security Concepts :
Authentication
Authorization
Principal
Granted Authority
Roles

3. We can configure this user name and password. One way is we add the value in properties file.
Eg:
spring.security.user.name=sahil
spring.security.user.password=sahil

4. We can use Spring AuthenticationManager
a. Get hold of Authentication Manager Builder
b. Set the configuration on it

We tell Authentication Manager Builder what type of authentication we need ( eg. in memory) and the we tell username, 
password and role. It has a class that has a configure method which takes Authentication Manager Builder. We can override the method
and do the configuration.

We can also set a password encoder
